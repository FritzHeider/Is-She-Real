## The burnout problem

Analyst burnout is real. Siloed tooling, fragmented context, and manual triage force teams into reactive firefighting.

## Automate the repetitive

- Let automation deflect repeat abuse scenarios with guardrails.
- Standardize enrichment so incidents arrive pre-labeled and prioritized.
- Give analysts narrative context, not just raw signals.

## Build regenerative workflows

Pair every playbook with an automated follow-up that closes the loop. Feed learnings back into the models so the system gets smarter with every incident.
