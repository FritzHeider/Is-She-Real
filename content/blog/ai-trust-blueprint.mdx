## Rethinking the trust stack

Modern trust teams are moving from reactive reviews to proactive orchestration. The core pillars include:

- **Signal capture everywhere.** Every touchpoint streams enriched signals into a unified model plane.
- **Adaptive models.** Fine-tuned per market, language, and abuse vertical with continuous evaluation.
- **Operator co-pilots.** Human-in-the-loop journeys that surface narrative context for complex calls.

## The new operating model

1. Centralize governance across automation, abuse, and operations.
2. Standardize runbooks around shared metrics such as time-to-intervention.
3. Empower analysts with tooling that feels cinematicâ€”context first, triage later.

## Measuring impact

Success metrics go beyond simple accuracy. Teams track deflection rates, analyst satisfaction, and downstream retention to prove business value.
