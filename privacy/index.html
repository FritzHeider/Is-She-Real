      <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
      <p class="lead">Updated <time datetime="2024-06-05">June 5, 2024</time>. We built Is She Real to keep authenticity investigations fast and transparent while respecting the privacy of the people and organizations being reviewed.</p>

      <section>
        <h2>Who we are</h2>
        <p>Is She Real is an authenticity intelligence workspace that blends metadata, language cues, and forensic imagery signals. We operate from the United States and comply with applicable U.S. state privacy laws and the GDPR where it applies.</p>
      </section>

      <section>
        <h2>Information we collect</h2>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Account basics.</strong> Email addresses, names, organization details, and authentication metadata collected when you request access or connect single sign-on.</li>
          <li><strong>Workspace activity.</strong> Audit logs showing when teams run analyses, export reports, or adjust configuration. We record timestamps, the workspace user, and a summary of the action.</li>
          <li><strong>Uploaded media.</strong> Images submitted to the forensic lab. By default they are processed in the browser and never leave your device. If you connect your own API endpoint we proxy uploads directly to your infrastructure.</li>
          <li><strong>Service diagnostics.</strong> IP addresses, device information, and event telemetry that help us secure accounts, prevent abuse, and debug the product.</li>
        </ul>
      </section>

      <section>
        <h2>How we use information</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>Provide, secure, and optimize the detection workspace.</li>
          <li>Deliver support responses, product updates, and incident notifications.</li>
          <li>Research new authenticity signals while measuring false positives and bias.</li>
          <li>Comply with legal obligations and enforce our Terms of Service.</li>
        </ul>
      </section>

      <section>
        <h2>Retention and deletion</h2>
        <p>Account and billing records are stored for the duration of your contract and as required by law. Workspace logs are kept for twelve months unless you request a shorter retention period. You can delete exports and cached reports at any time from the product, and you can submit a formal deletion request using the process described on our <a href="/daletion/">data deletion page</a>.</p>
      </section>

      <section>
        <h2>Sharing and transfers</h2>
        <p>We do not sell customer data. We may share limited personal data with processors that provide hosting, security, billing, email delivery, and analytics. Whenever data leaves your chosen region we use Standard Contractual Clauses or an equivalent safeguard.</p>
      </section>

      <section>
